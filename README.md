# guess-game

A Simple Web Game I Made Using Javascript

The game will generate a random number

The user will have to guess the number

If they guessed wrongly they will have to guess again(they will also be given a hint)

If they guessed the correct number, they will win.....

If you wanna continue after you win, you can just reload the page

Here's how it looks like: https://hallowdread.github.io/guess-game/

You can clone or just download the zipped folder

still here learning my first language.......
